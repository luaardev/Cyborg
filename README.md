Wireless robotic arm

##  Introduction 
In the modern world, robots and its variants are used in almost everywhere. Robots can be said as an electrical-mechanical device that can be controlled with a computer or a micro-controller. Robotic arm is a device or robot that can perform same functions as a human arm or hand. Robotic arm plays a major role in various industries. Robotic arm is used in welding, drilling, painting, picking and placing etc.
The biggest advantage of the robotic arm is that it can work in hazardous situations where human cannot reach. Robotic arm has some variants like keyboard controlled, Gesture controlled, Remote controlled. Still many industries uses a tedious and time consuming technique to program the robots. So our main motto is to control the robotic arm through the voice commands to provide easy and convenient way. We will provide some basic commands that control the arm and then users can create and store their own commands for the combined task. Now, In case where voice commands cannot be recognized we will provide other way to control the arm so that, it can work in any way.
